1. Problem Definition
	Identify the goal: Classify brain MRI images into tumor types or detect presence of tumor.
	Define the problem as a supervised image classification task.
	Specify project scope: dataset size, evaluation metrics (accuracy, F1-score, etc.), and deployment target (web, API, etc.).
2. Data Collection
	Use a Brain MRI dataset (e.g., Kaggle Brain Tumor Dataset or custom one).
	Ensure it includes clear class labels (e.g., glioma, meningioma, pituitary, no tumor).
	Organize data structure:
	brain_mri_dataset/
	    ├── training/
	    │   ├── glioma/
	    │   ├── meningioma/
	    │   ├── pituitary/
	    │   └── notumor/
	    ├── testing/
	    │   ├── ...
3. Data Preprocessing
	Resize all images (e.g., 224×224 or 128×128).
	Normalize pixel values (0–1 range).
	Perform data augmentation (rotation, zoom, flip, brightness).
	Handle class imbalance (oversampling or class weights).
	Split data into train, validation, and test sets.
4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
	Visualize a few samples per class.
	Count samples per class to detect imbalance.
	Plot pixel intensity distributions.
	Verify image quality (blurriness, contrast).
5. Feature Engineering (optional)
	Extract CNN-based features (using pretrained models like VGG16, ResNet50, EfficientNet).
	Optionally reduce dimensionality with PCA if you want to test traditional ML models.
6. Model Development
	Option A: Deep Learning
	Use CNN architectures:
	Custom CNN (for understanding)
	Transfer Learning (ResNet50, DenseNet, EfficientNet, MobileNet)
	Use frameworks: TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch.
	Train model on training data, validate using validation set.
	Option B: Hybrid Approach
	Extract embeddings from pretrained CNNs.
	Feed embeddings into ML classifiers (SVM, RandomForest, XGBoost).
7. Model Evaluation
	Evaluate with metrics:
	Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score
	Confusion matrix
	ROC curve (if binary)
	Compare performance between models.
8. Model Optimization
	Use hyperparameter tuning (learning rate, batch size, epochs).
	Apply regularization (dropout, L2).
	Use early stopping to prevent overfitting.
9. Model Testing
	Evaluate final model on unseen test set.
	Save model in .h5 or .pt format.
10. Model Explainability (optional but valuable)
	Use Grad-CAM or LIME to visualize what the model focuses on in MRI images.
	Helps verify medical relevance.
11. Deployment Pipeline
	Backend
	Create an API (Flask/FastAPI) to serve the model.
	Define endpoint /predict that receives an image and returns predicted tumor type.
	Frontend
	Build a simple web interface:
	Upload MRI image
	Display prediction result and confidence score
	Apply MindScan color theme (purple).
12. Evaluation in Production
	Test inference time, model response speed.
	Check model generalization on new MRI scans.
	Collect feedback for retraining.
13. Documentation & Reporting
	Dataset organization and quality report.
	Preprocessing notebook.
	Model performance summary.
	Final report with methodology, results, and conclusion.
14. (Optional) Integration with Telemedicine
	Allow doctors to upload MRI scans and receive automated analysis.
	Store predictions with patient records.
